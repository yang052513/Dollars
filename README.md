## What is Dollars?

Dollars is an online web chat app that allows you and your friends chatting and have fun! The idea is inspired by Animation Durarara!!. The chatting room in Durarara!! is anonymous which means each user's account name is not real, and no one knows each other. There is no user verification in that chatting room, so user could login and talk on the go. I made the app mainly for fun (lol) and practice database skill since it's my first time manipulate data realtime.
